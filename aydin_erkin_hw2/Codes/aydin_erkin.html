/* 
 * In Javascript, you can use "break" statement without labels.
 * In this use, it just exits the loop the break statement is in, not any
 * other loop in outer scope. This example demonstrates how a "break"
 * works without any label. The for loop would've iterate up to 5 an then terminate
 * if we didn't have the break statement in a condition. Thus, it will print 0,1 and 2
 * to the console and then exit.

/*
 * In Javascript, "continue" statement can be used to terminate a single iteration and proceed with others.
 * In this example, the expected behaviour is to print values 0, 1, 2, and 4, but not 3, as the iteration will be
 * terminated in before the print statement when i === 3.

 * It is also possible to use "continue" statement with labels, to specify which loops iteration to cut in half.
 * In this example, the outer while loops iterations will be terminated when i === j. Thus, we won't ever see values
 * of j greater or equal to i printed. We also won't see "i is great!" printed, as the iteration of the outer loop
 * will always be terminated in the middle.
